Cloudtari
=========

This is an Atari 2600 emulator that can stream the video over a
network, currently using VNC or alternately as a stream of GIFs
to a web browser.

Using some PHP and Python code on a webserver, it can be set up
using Kubernetes so a web browser can pick a ROM to play and the
game will be launched on a node in the Kubernetes cluster and be
playable in the browser.
